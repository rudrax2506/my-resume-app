This React-based resume application showcases a clean, modern design and highlights professional experience, technical skills, and personal information in a single-page layout. Built with React and bundled via Vite, it leverages a component-based architecture for maintainability and responsive design principles for a seamless user experience on various devices. React Hooks such as useState and useEffect are used for theme toggling and local storage management, ensuring a smooth transition between dark and light modes. The application also employs ARIA labels and concise CSS transitions for accessibility and user-friendly interactions.
